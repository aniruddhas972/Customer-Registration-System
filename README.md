# Customer-Registration-System
The Customer Registration Project is an academic endeavor designed to register customers using validations based on mobile number, email, and PAN card. It involves generating and sending OTPs via a third-party API and managing customer details through six controller classes, including CustomerDetailsController, OtpDetailsController, and AddressController.
